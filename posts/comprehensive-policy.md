JavaScript powers the web - it's **the** most important programming language you need to know as a web developer.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
const basics = 'I\'ll have a bloody Mary and a steak sandwich and a...steak sandwich.';

let iPurchasedTheTicketsForMsCavanaugh = true;

function seatPrefs() {
  if (iPurchasedTheTicketsForMsCavanaugh) {
    const doesntMeanIWantHerSittingNextToMe = true;
    console.log(doesntMeanIWantHerSittingNextToMe);
  }
}

seatPrefs();
```
